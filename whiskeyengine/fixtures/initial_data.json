He used a traditional corn base, but mixed in small grains in his mash to capture the spicy flavor of rye and complement the sweet smoothness of corn. More than 200 years later, Basil Hayden's is a singular bourbon that bridges the flavor of rye whiskies and small batch bourbons together.\r\n\r\nBasil Hayden's is unequaled in that it utilizes twice as much rye in it as the other bourbons in the Collection. Enriched by a hint of peppermint, it impresses with notes of pepper balanced by slight citrus overtones, and a spicy, warming finish. Aged eight years at a relatively mild 80 proof, Basil Hayden's has a broad appeal and is equally enjoyable alone or in cocktails such as a Juicy Basil and Basil Bubbly.",

Whiskey derived from 51 percent corn grain does not have to be aged; if it is aged, it is usually aged no longer than six months in uncharred old oak barrels. Straight whiskey, however, refers to whiskey that has been aged for two years in charred new oak barrels. The bourbon label comes from the Kentucky county in which American whiskey bourbon was created, Bourbon County. Old Cabin Still True Handmade Bourbon Whiskey, however, was distilled in Philadelphia by E.G. Booz starting in 1840.

In 1999, our distillers, Miles & Marko, said, \"What if?\"  They decided to distill 20,000 gallons of bottle-ready Pilsner beer to create CHARBAY Whiskey.  It took them 3.5 weeks of 24/7 distilling, taking shifts to check on the Pot Still every 3-4 hours. (One of the main reasons nearly all whiskey is column distilled.)  In 2002, we released the first 2 barrels. Just 3 years old, it was dangerously smooth at cask strength (129.4 proof).  Six years later, we're pleased to announce that Release II is ready!! Miles & Marko selected 5 barrels - 124 cases. \r\n\r\n\"There is no other whiskey out that you can really taste the beer that it's made from\", says Marko.  \"The spice from the hops and the barley flavors are very well balanced with just the right amount of oak.\"",

An especially appropriate description of this new limited edition small batch Bourbon collection, as well as an appropriate description of the exclusive, and artful, mingling process that has been perfected at Four Roses.\r\n\r\nAnd marriage is linked to the tradition of the Four Roses brand. It began when Paul Jones, Jr., the founder of Four Roses Bourbon, became smitten by the beauty of a Southern belle. It is said that he sent a proposal to her, and she replied that if her answer were \"Yes,\" she would wear a corsage of roses on her gown to the upcoming grand ball. Paul Jones waited for her answer excitedly on that night of the grand ball ... when she arrived in her beautiful gown, she wore a corsage of four red roses. He later named his Bourbon \"Four Roses\" as a symbol of his devout passion for the lovely belle, a passion he thereafter transferred to making his beloved Four Roses Bourbon.\r\n\r\nSo today, from time to time, our Master Distiller will select a few exceptional barrels and then, like an artist, marry their aromas, textures and flavors by hand to create a true masterpiece - an exquisite limited edition small batch Bourbon for the Mariage Collection. One time, two of Four Roses\u2019 ten Bourbon recipes might be married together. Another time and it may be five.

Authentic whiskey selection is a recognizable strength of Preiss Imports.

Hirsch Reserve Bourbon whiskey hails from the time-honored pot-still tradition; slow, costly, work intensive, but a delicious relic of American history.\r\n\r\nPretty medium amber color; superb purity.

Entry takes my breath away as the rollicking aspects of the aroma suddenly calm down into a sophisticated and caramel-sweet opening taste experience that\u2019s oily, spiced, and remarkably fruity (raisins, dates); mid-palate taste profile jumps off the radar screen as the multilayered flavor dives deeply into bakery shop tastes (prune Danish, raspberry-filled cookie, strawberry\u2026oh man, this one is ripe and bountiful) as well as nutty and woody (maple syrup). Finishes semisweet and honeyed, rich but vibrant, and not the least fat or clunky, and simply divinely delicious.

Entry is flowery (rose petals), spiced and curiously astringent; mid-palate offers atypical tastes of dried flowers in your yearbook, dried fruits (pears, apricots), nut butter, and cooking oil.

Knob Creek embodies the bold flavor that has made Kentucky famous for bourbon.

      "description": "Strong and humbling, Rebel Yell Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey has a truly unforgettable taste. As one of the few wheated bourbons on the market today, Rebel Yell is made using only the choicest ingredients, pure limestone-filtered water and new charred white oak barrels for aging.\r\n\r\nRebel Yell boasts a honey raisin scent and a long, warm finish. A full-bodied whiskey with honey, butter and a hint of dark fruit (plums, raisins) gives this wheated bourbon a unique style.\r\n\r\nLike all fine bourbons, Rebel Yell is steeped in tradition. The first bottle was produced in 1849 by the W.L. Weller family, the first distillers to produce Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey using wheat instead of rye in the mash bill.",

Finally, in Bardstown, Nelson County, Kentucky - the \"Bourbon Centre\" of the World - the Willett family distillers became involved with developing several of the most famous bourbon distilleries of the area and, in the early 1900's decided to build their family owned and operated distillery.  The distillery they named \"The Willett Distilling Company\" in 1935, which has been operated by several generations of Willett family distillers since its very beginning, is today the home of \"Kentucky Bourbon Distillers, Ltd.\", still headed by a member of the same family as its originators.",

We have tasted and evaluated nearly every American whiskey that is regularly available on the market in order to identify the shared characteristics that connect certain American whiskeys to one another. The idea for this tool evolved from many conversations with our guests in the restaurant who want to try new things, but don\u2019t know all of the different whiskeys available and are concerned about spending money on a whiskey that they might not like. We know that taste is subjective and we don\u2019t expect agreement on every whiskey that the Whiskey Engine suggests you will like. Our hope is that you are inspired and encouraged to try whiskeys you are not familiar with and through that process you will better understand and appreciate American whiskey.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately Whiskey Engine will be fueled by the community that creates the content on the site through opinions, reviews and tasting notes.
