				<p><strong>Char No. 4</strong> is a whiskey bar and restaurant inspired by a passion for bourbon. The name refers to the practice of aging bourbon in charred new oak barrels, which gives bourbon its characteristic sweet, caramelized flavors and its beautiful amber hue. <strong>Char No. 4</strong> features over 150 American whiskeys and serves a menu of American fare with a focus on smoked meat. The American whiskeys are augmented by an extensive list of whiskeys from Europe and beyond as well as a selection of all-bourbon cocktails.</p>

				<p>The restaurant  is located in a 19th century row house in Cobble Hill  Brooklyn. The design environment takes inspiration from this tradition in its treatment of light, its use of color, and in its nod to the form and construction of whiskey barrels both within the water-jet cut pattern of the steel facade, and in custom designed light fixtures. A field of large cylindrical pendants suffuse the space with a tawny glow that sets a mood of sophisticated conviviality for both drinking and dining. The light transmitted through these fixtures bathes the entire space in a golden hue which reinforces the many colors of whiskey displayed in a custom designed LED-lit cabinet behind the bar.</p>
